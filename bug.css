The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on values. However, if the calculation results in an invalid value, it can cause unexpected behavior.  For example, trying to calculate a negative width or height will often result in the element not rendering correctly or being hidden.  Additionally, using units inconsistently (mixing `px` and `%` without proper conversion) can also lead to unexpected results. A common issue arises when dealing with percentages relative to unknown or dynamic parent container dimensions during page load or resize events. This can make accurate sizing and positioning unpredictable.
